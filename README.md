### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you've installed [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.html). **Make sure you're using the latest version instead of the recommended version or it will crash.**
2. You'll probably want to create a separate game directory for playerinfo to run in. More info <a href="#directory">here</a>.
3. Run this version of Forge at least once in order to create the mods folder.

### <a name="starting"></a>Getting Started
1. Go to the [playerinfo website](https://playerinfo-frontend.vercel.app).
2. Click download. It should automatically take you to the latest release of playerinfo on GitHub. You can also click <a href="https://github.com/PepperLola/playerinfo/releases/latest">here</a>.
3. Download the release. Make sure you download `playerinfo-XX.XX.XX.jar` and **not** `playerinfo-XX.XX.XX-sources.jar`. You don't want the sources jar.
4. Put the jar you downloaded into your mods folder and start Forge.
5. Report any issues <a href="https://github.com/PepperLola/playerinfo/issues">here</a>, as well as any feature requests. Be sure to either include `[Bug]/[Feature Request]` in the title, depending on the reason behind the issue.

### <a name="directory"></a>Game Directory
1. Create a new folder in your `.minecraft` directory. Name it something along the lines of `Forge playerinfo`. You can name it whatever you want, but descriptive names are better so you'll remember what the folder was for in the future.
2. Edit the installation of Forge in the Minecraft launcher by clicking `Installations`, scrolling to the one for Forge 1.8.9 that you're using, click the 3 dots and choose `Edit`. Under `Game Directory`, click browse and navigate to the folder you created in the previous step.
3. Choose that folder, and save the settings for the installation.

### Note
This project was created for fun, and I don't expect anyone but myself (and maybe some friends) to actually use it. I would recommend instead using a more well-known, well-made and well-maintained PvP client such as LunarClient. I would recommend Badlion but ewww.
